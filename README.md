# `pandoras_pot` - Unleash Unfathomable Curses on Unsuspecting Bots... In Rust!

Inspired by [HellPot](https://github.com/yunginnanet/HellPot), `pandoras_pot`
aims to bring even more misery on unruly web crawlers that doesn't respect your
`robots.txt`.

The goal with `pandoras_pot` is to have maximum data output, while not using up
all the resources of your webserver that probably could be doing better things
with its time.

To ensure that bots don't detect `pandoras_pot`, it uses Markov chains to
generate data based on *The Sorrows of Young Werther*. This will hopefully keep
them both busy and educated.
